Brian,

- Congratulations on passing the judge Kattis!

- Good style!

However, 

- There is no evidence that you submitted the program in kattis and that you
  passed it.

- Classes of this type should usually be public, but you did not specifically
  made the class public.

- The program is missing the header specified in the style guidelines:
  /**
   * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
   * author: student name
   * course: CMPT 220
   * assignment: project 1
   * due date: August 30, 2003
   * version: 1.3
   * 
   * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
   * type.
   */

- Please read the style guidelines to make sure you understand them. Do not
  hesitate to ask any questions.


Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
